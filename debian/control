Description: Deconstruct and reconstruct firmware images
 The Firmware Mod Kit allows for easy deconstruction and reconstruction of
 firmware images for various embedded devices. While it primarily targets Linux
 based routers, it should be compatible with most firmware that makes use of
 common firmware formats and file systems such as TRX/uImage and
 SquashFS/CramFS.
